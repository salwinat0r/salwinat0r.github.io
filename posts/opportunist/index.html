<p>There is inherently nothing wrong about being a <em>==opportunist==</em>. It&rsquo;s hardcoded into your DNA to do anything and everything to survive. In a social setting, this is might be to seek approval from others.</p>
<h6 id=what-makes-it-not-ethical>What makes it <strong>not ethical</strong>?</h6>
<p>You could certainly be butthurt about the other individual stealing your alpha. To some, they might not give a shit.
Is social conduct then opposing natural selection? There is no denying that the opportunist is the one who climbs up the corporate ladder. It baffles me how some see through opportunists while some are delusional and appreciate the disguised sincerity of the person.
The opportunist is certainly happy about what they&rsquo;re doing. At some point, they might be shocked by how they cannot please everyone.
Hating them doesn&rsquo;t do you any good. So is competing for alpha the only way to make sure you climb the ladders as well?</p>
<p>The best way is as stoic as it gets. Don&rsquo;t give a shit. Don&rsquo;t be bothered about how someone else is not doing it <strong>the right way.</strong> You could always achieve that by walking the talk.</p>
